# Vehicle-classification

This python program classificates between 6 classes of vehicles using IA.

For this code I used different libraries, but the most important one is tensorflow.keras. This library has many tools for training models, and seeing the improvements. 

After some days training the model with different neuronal networks, I found this last model which has very great accuracies. These results were tested by 3 jpgs with a car, a bicycle, and a truck made out of CGI. 

The model structure is saved on the filepath given in a .json, and the weights generated in a .h5.

The data was download from diferent datasets of kaggle, all about vehicle classification.
